Global To-Do List:

TODO: Bring in mocha for testing
TODO: Filters, Intents, and other still using constructor.name.  Need to show filename. 
	Easiest way may be to add a getName() function to all objects during loading (if not already set)
	Note to self: Search all code for constructor.name
TODO: Allow the intent handlers to call the standard callback to lambda with the actual result
	I'll have to intercept it to allow the filters to complete and then let it fire correctly
TODO: Change FilterExecutor and SessionHandlerExecutor to use Promise()
