Global To-Do List:

FIXME: Change IntentHandlerProviderByDirectory to handle not only objects that are brought in by require, 
	but also module.exports = {} with the function in the module.exports
FIXME: processItem(items, itemId, ..).. pass in items so everything can write to it
		ItemProcessors should not return anything

TODO: Bring in mocha for testing
