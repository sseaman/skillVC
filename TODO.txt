Global To-Do List:

TODO: Bring in mocha for testing
TODO: Update all docs to new IntentHandler call signature as well as no longer having to be an object

Winston-Simple:
TODO: Add function on log for getLevel(). See if Winston exposes this first
TODO: Add static map for log levels so I don't have to code 'debug' everywhere, I can just do something
		like log.LEVELS.DEBUG.  THis would allow log.getLevel() === log.LEVELS.DEBUG
		Actually, it would be better to do log.isDebug() , log.isInfo(), etc.. as that would be easier but
		would not scale for custom levels...
