License\n\n## Installation\n-----\nYou can install winston-simple in your project's `node_modules` folder, or you can install it globally.\n\nTo install the latest version available on NPM:\n\n    npm install winston-simple\n\nTo install the latest development version:\n\n    npm install git+https://github.com/sseaman/winston-simple.git\n\n## Source / Webpage\n-----\nwinston-simple is maintained in GitHub.  For full source to to [GitHub winston-simple](https://github.com/sseaman/winston-simple)\n\n## Usage\n-----\nwinston-simple is a log4j style wrapper for [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) logging that supports\nper object log level setting, global log level setting, or global disabled logging.  winston-simple uses simple \nmap configuration to determine how logging is contolled.\n\n### Log Levels\nwinston-simples uses the same npm logging levels of [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) with one \naddition: `none`, which will disable logging for a specifed object.\n\nThe full list of logging levels are:\n```{ none, error: 0, warn: 1, info: 2, verbose: 3, debug: 4, silly: 5 }```\n\n### Configuration \nwinston-simple uses a map to set the log levels of the objects that you wish to control the logging level.  The\nkey of the map represents the name of the object.  The value is the level of the logging.  Once the logging level is set\nin winston-simple you never need to set it again, but you can modify it at any time and it will apply the changes to the logging \nlevels realtime.\n\n### Per Object Configuration\n\n```\n{\n\t\"MyObjectName\"  : \"debug\",\n\t\"AnotherObject\" : \"info\",\n\tand so on\n}\n```\n\nThe above would set the the log level of `MyObjectName` to `debug` and `AnotherObject` to `info`.  All other objects will have logging disabled.\n\n### Global Configuraton\nwinston-simple supports the idea of global configuration for all objects that wish to do logging.  To enable global logging levels\nuse the `all` key for the map.  The value is the level of the logging to apply to all object.\n\n```\n{\n\t\"all\" : \"debug\"\n}\n```\nThe above would set all logging levels for all objects to \"debug\".\n\nYou can also disable logging for all objects by setting the logging levels to:\n\n```\n{\n\t\"all\" : \"none\"\n}\n```\n\n### Combining Global and per object\nwinston-simple also support a combination of per object and global configuration.  This allow a default log level to be \nset for all object levels but different specific levels for certain objects\n\nExample:\n```\n{\n\t\"all\" \t\t\t: \"debug\",\n\t\"MyObjectName\"\t: \"info\"\n}\n```\n\n### Log Format\nwinston-simple defaults to the standard [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) configuration, but with the \naddition of the Object name as a label.\nThis results in the following formatted log entry:\n\n```\n2016-10-07T19:24:56.995Z - info: [MyObjectName] This is the log message\n```\n\n### Usage in Code\nTo set the log levels used by winston-simple first require the npm package and then set the logging level.\n```\nvar Logger = require('winston-simple);\nLogger.setLevels({\n\t'all' : 'debug',\n\t'MyObjectName' : 'info'\n});\n```\n\nYou can the use the Logger to get a logger for use in your code:\n```\nvar log = Logger.getLogger('MyObjectName');\n\nlog.debug(\"This is a debug message\");\n```\n\n### Customization\nwinston-simple exposes it's underlying [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) instance so that you may \nconfigure winston-simple however you want.  \n\nTo retreived the instance, simply call `getWinston()` on your winston-simple instance.  Any changes made to the\nreturned [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) object will be applied to all loggers.\n\n## Example\n-----\nThe following example shows the tightest way to initialize winston-simple.\n\n**/index.js**\n\n```\nvar log = require('winston-simple').setLevels(\n\t{\n\t\t'all' : 'info',\n\t\t'SomeObject' : 'debug'\n\t}).getLogger(\"Index\");\n\n//some code....\nlog.info(\"This will be logged\");\nlog.debug(\"This will NOT be logged\");\n```\n\n**/lib/SomeObject.js**\n```\nvar log = require('winston-simple').getLogger('SomeObject');\n\nlog.info(\"This will be logged\");\nlog.debug(\"This will also be logged because it was configued in index.js\");\n```\n\n## License\n-----\nwinston-simple is copyright (c) 2016-present Sloan Seaman <sloan@pobox.com>.\n\nwinston-simple is free software, licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).",
