SkillVC was written in a very basic format, on purpose.  The code is intended to hopefully be easy to follow and execute
as quickly as possible.  The code is also Object Oriented in nature in an attempt promote code reuse as well as extensibility.

For formatted documentation, please see [SkillVC API Docs](https://sseaman.github.io/skillVC/api)
